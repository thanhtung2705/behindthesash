# WordPress

This is a WordPress repository configured to run on the [Pantheon platform](https://pantheon.io).

Pantheon is website platform optimized and configured to run high performance sites with an amazing developer workflow. There is built-in support for features such as Varnish, Redis, Apache Solr, New Relic, Nginx, PHP-FPM, MySQL, PhantomJS and more.Â 

## Getting Started

### 1. Spin-up a site

If you do not yet have a Pantheon account, you can create one for free. Once you've verified your email address, you will be able to add sites from your dashboard. Choose "WordPress" to use this distribution.

### 2. Load up the site

When the spin-up process is complete, you will be redirected to the site's dashboard. Click on the link under the site's name to access the Dev environment.

### 3. Run the WordPress installer

How about the WordPress database config screen? No need to worry about database connection information as that is taken care of in the background. The only step that you need to complete is the site information and the installation process will be complete.

We will post more information about how this works but we recommend developers take a look at `wp-config.php` to get an understanding.

If you would like to keep a separate set of configuration for local development, you can use a file called `wp-config-local.php`, which is already in our .gitignore file.

### 4. Enjoy!

# Pantheon Empty Upstream

This is an empty repository that is, save for this explanatory text, devoid of all content. This upstream is appropriate to use in situations where a Pantheon site will be created through a build step (see the [Terminus Build Tools Plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin) and managed completely by Composer. Typically, the build step should completely replace the content provided by the upstream. If this README persists after the build step, it will do no harm; however, it would be advisable to replace this text with a description of the project.

If this upstream is used to install a site that does not have a build step, then you will not be able to install or use your site. In that event, the best thing to do would be to delete it and start over, either by selecting a different upstream, or by using the [Terminus Build Tools Plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin) `terminus build-env:create-project` command to set up a build server.
